<h1>Wedding Song Planner</h1>
A full-stack web app I built using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, and Passport Login. The user can access detailed ceremony and reception planners, fill in song submission forms, and delete submissions with the option to submit a final version.

<b>Goals:</b>
This was one of my first projects using EJS and MongoDB with the goal of receiving the user's song submissions and storing the data in a database. I also wanted to create a function to let users modify their submissions.

<b>Results:</b>
I learned how to use conditionals in EJS files in order for the user to submit a final version of their submissions on the server side. After this project, I feel super comfortable using beestings as well as storing important user data in MongoDB.
